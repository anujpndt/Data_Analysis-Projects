# Project 1 :- 
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sales data to extract meaningful insights and patterns. The EDA process includes analyzing various aspects of the sales dataset, such as distributions, correlations, and outliers. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, identify key features, and provide insights that can assist in making informed business decisions and optimizations. The resulting analysis and insights will be shared in this repository for reference and collaboration.
# Project 2 :-
This GitHub project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of movie-related data. EDA is a critical step in understanding the underlying patterns, trends, and characteristics of the dataset. The movie data in this project is thoroughly analyzed, visualized, and interpreted to extract meaningful insights. The analysis covers various aspects such as movie genres, ratings, release dates, and other relevant information. The objective is to provide a comprehensive view of the movie dataset, aiding further research, decision-making, or applications in the domain of film industry analysis.
